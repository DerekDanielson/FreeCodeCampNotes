//Declare JS Variables  ------  Use 'let' vs 'var'
var exampleName;
let exampleName;


//Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
let abc;
abc = 38;    //abc will store 38


//Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
let cat = 10;
let dog = cat; // dog = 10


//Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
let car = 'Mustang';


//Understanding Uninitialized Variables - When Variables are declared they have an initial value of 'undefined'.
var ten = 10;
var five = 5;
var sentence = 'I am a ';

ten = ten + 5;  // 15
five = five + 1;  // 6
sentence = sentence + 'string';  //'I am a string'


//Add two numbers with JS
let sum = 10 + 20; //30


//Subtract One Number from Another  with JS
let difference = 30 - 20; //10


//Multiply 
let multi = 10 * 8; //80


//Divide
let divide = 10 / 2; //5


//Increment a number with JS  - Using ++ to add 1 number
let myVar = 68;
myVar++; //69


//Decrement a number with JS  - Using -- to subtract 1 number
let myVar = 70;
myVar--; //69


//Create Decimal numbers with JS
let myDecimal = 3.8;


//Multiply two decimals with JS
let prod = 2.0 * 3.5; //7


//Divide one Decimal by Another with JS
let quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; //2.2


//Finding a Remainder in JS   - Using "Remainder operator" (%)
let remainder = 11 % 3;


//Compound Assignment with Augmented Addition
let addMore = 10;
addMore += 20; //30


//Compound Assignment with Augmented Subtraction
let subMore = 50;
subMore -= 20; //30


//Compound Assignment with Augmented Multiplication
let multiMore = 3;
multiMore *= 10; //30


//Compound Assignment with Augmented Division
let divMore = 12;
divMore /= 3; //4


//Declare String Variables  ---  "String literals(strings) are characters enclosed in quotes"
let name = 'Sadie';//'Sadie'


//Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings - In JS you can "escape" a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash(\) in front of the quote
let myStr = "This is a \"double quoted\" string"; //"This is a "double quoted" string"


//Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
let goodStr = 'He said "hey let\'s go" to her'; //'He said "hey let's go" to her'


//Escape Sequences in Strings
//  \'  Single quote
//  \"  Double quote
//  \\  Backslash
//  \n  New line
//  \r  Carriage return
//  \t  Tab
//  \b  Word boundary
//  \f  Form feed


//Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
let newSentence = 'Hello ' + 'Goodbye'; //'Hello Goodbye'


//Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
let newSent = 'Hello';
newSent += 'Goodbye'; //'Hello Goodbye'


//Constructing Strings with Variables
let mysteryInc = meddlingKids
let capture = 'those' + mysteryInc + 'and that dog'; //'those meddling kids and that dog'


//Appending Variables to Strings
let goDo = 'get this!!!!';
let newLine = 'I will ';
newLine += goDo; //'I will get this!!!!'


//Find the Length of a String
